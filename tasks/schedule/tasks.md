# ðŸ¤– Codex Agent Protocol: Tiffany

Welcome, Codex or autonomous contributor.

Tiffany is a coroutine-first autonomous agent runtime. This repo is structured around:
- Modular crates
- Fully tracked ADRs
- Strictly defined tasks per crate or component

## Agent Workflow Rules

1. **All changes must be tied to a task.**
    - Tasks are stored in `tasks/<crate>/tasks.md`

2. **Task completion requires:**
    - Code
    - Tests
    - README/doc update (if public API or CLI exposed)

3. **You may generate new tasks** from:
    - `docs/mdbook/src/adr/*.md`
    - `docs/mdbook/src/concepts/*.md`
    - `canvas/` (if reason-act context is active)

4. **Do not write to crates outside the current task scope.**
    - Use interfaces exposed by other crates.
    - If you need changes, create a dependency task.

5. **Tests must be deterministic and run under `just test`.**

# Scheduler Task Refinement (MVP Fixes)

## Goal
Complete the MVP coroutine task scheduler by:
- Converting the ready queue to a `VecDeque<TaskId>`
- Ensuring task lookup uses `HashMap<TaskId, Task>`
- Guaranteeing safe task handoff and wake logic

## Tasks

- [x] Replace `VecDeque<Task>` with `VecDeque<TaskId>` in `scheduler.rs`
- [x] In `spawn()`, push the new `TaskId` into the queue â€” not the `Task` itself
- [x] In `run()`, pop a `TaskId` and `get_mut()` the task from the map
- [x] Remove any logic cloning or moving the `Task` struct (it contains `JoinHandle` and is not `Clone`)
- [x] Add integration test that spawns two tasks and tracks their `SystemCall::Done` order
- [x] Confirm that scheduler exits cleanly after all tasks complete
- [x] Wrap the call to `may::coroutine::spawn` in an explicit `unsafe` block in `Scheduler::spawn`
- [x] Replace any placeholder tests with meaningful coverage for the ready queue
- [x] Implement join waiting via a `WaitMap` so tasks blocked on `Join` resume when the joined task completes
- [x] Add `IoWait` syscall and resume logic using a signal channel

## Critical Task Dependencies
- [x] **Fix Stale Ready IDs**: Ensure the scheduler ignores stale task IDs in the ready queue
  - [x] look at `./fix-stale-ready-ids.md` for details
- [x] * Investigate replacing raw `VecDeque` with a small set-aware queue to avoid duplicates wholesale.
- [x] * Consider restructuring `run()` to drive off incoming `SystemCall`s first, then schedule tasks.
- [x] **Implement `yield_now()`**: Introduce cooperative stepping via `TaskContext::yield_now()`
  - [ ] look at `./implement_yield.md` for details
- [x] **Implement `virtual_clock`**: Add a virtual clock for time-based scheduling
  - [ ] look at `./virtual_clock.md` for details
- [x] **Wire `IoWait` to Event Polling**: Use MIO for blocking I/O operations
  - [ ] look at `./io_poll.md` for details
- [ ] **Implement `io_registry_trait`**: Define a trait for I/O resource registration and lookup. See `./io_registry_trait.md` for requirements.
  - [ ] Run `cargo nextest` with and without `--features async-io` to ensure full test coverage.
- [ ] **Implement `io_event_loop`**: Build the event loop for I/O polling and task wakeup. Refer to `./io_event_loop.md` for design details.
  - [ ] Run `cargo nextest` with and without `--features async-io` to verify correctness.
- [ ] **Implement `cancel_timeout`**: Add support for task cancellation and timeouts. See `./cancel_timeout.md` for implementation notes.
  - [ ] Run `cargo nextest` with and without `--features async-io` to confirm behavior.
- [ ] **Implement `priority_queue`**: Integrate a priority-aware scheduling queue. Details in `./priority_queue.md`.
  - [ ] Run `cargo nextest` with and without `--features async-io` to validate scheduling logic.
- [ ] **Implement `panic_isolation`**: Ensure that panics in tasks do not crash the scheduler. See `./panic_isolation.md` for isolation strategies.
  - [ ] Run `cargo nextest` with and without `--features async-io` to test resilience.
- [ ] **Implement `telemetry_hooks`**: Add hooks for task telemetry, metrics, and logging. Refer to `./telemetry_hooks.md` for integration points.
  - [ ] Run `cargo nextest` with and without `--features async-io` to check observability.
- [ ] **Implement `system_tasks`**: Provide system-level tasks and hooks for internal operations. See `./system_tasks.md` for task definitions.
  - [ ] Run `cargo nextest` with and without `--features async-io` to ensure system task coverage.
- [ ] **Implement `cpu_budget`**: Enforce CPU usage limits per task. Details in `./cpu_budget.md`.
  - [ ] Run `cargo nextest` with and without `--features async-io` to verify enforcement.
- [ ] **backpressure\_hook.md**:  
  Design and implement a backpressure mechanism for the scheduler. This should allow the system to detect when it is overloaded (e.g., too many tasks queued or resource contention) and apply strategies such as pausing task intake, signaling upstream producers, or prioritizing critical tasks. The hook must be configurable and expose metrics for observability.
- [ ] **graceful\_shutdown.md**:  
  Specify the process for shutting down the agent and scheduler gracefully. This includes draining the task queue, completing in-flight tasks, handling I/O cleanup, and ensuring all resources are released without data loss or corruption. The shutdown sequence should be interruptible and provide status updates.
- [ ] **sharded\_api.md**:  
  Outline the approach for sharding the API layer to support horizontal scaling. Define how requests are routed to the correct shard, how state is partitioned, and how inter-shard communication is managed. Address consistency, fault tolerance, and dynamic rebalancing.
- [ ] **state\_expansion.md**:  
  Describe the strategy for expanding and managing agent state as new features or data types are introduced. Cover versioning, migration, and backward compatibility. Include guidelines for state introspection, validation, and recovery in case of corruption or upgrade failures.

## Crate Types

| Crate      | Type       | Notes                       |
|------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| `cli`      | binary     | CLI for external interaction|
| `daemon`   | binary     | Agent boot + signal mgr     |
| `scheduler`| library    | Coroutine scheduler runtime |

## Communication Interfaces

- IPC via UDS or vsock
- gRPC (async, tonic)

## Output Guidelines

- All structs, enums, traits must be documented.
- Use `tracing::instrument` for runtime behavior visibility.
- When in doubt, log to PAL-compatible format.

Happy contributing ðŸ§š
